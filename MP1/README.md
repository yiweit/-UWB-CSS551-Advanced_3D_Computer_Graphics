## Getting to know the tools and weekend entertainment
### Objective
In this programming assignment, we familiarize with the learning tool, Unity, that we will be using for the rest of this quarter. You should also use this opportunity to:

- Evaluate how comfortable you are with the kinds of learning that is expected [mainly on how to use Unity as a tool].
- Ensure that you understand exactly what is involved in submitting a programming assignment.

This assignment should take you no more than 5 or 6 hours to complete. Most of the time should be spent on asking and looking for answers to: “how do I make Unity do …”
